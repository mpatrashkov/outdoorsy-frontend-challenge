This repo contains my implementation of the [Outdoorsy Frontend Challenge](https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-frontend).

## Running the project

First you need to install the dependencies using `npm install`.

Then you can either use `npm run dev` to start the project in dev mode, or run `npm run build && npm start` to start the project in prod mode. Both commands will start a server at port `3000`, so to access the app open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## What would I do differently if I had one week to work on this?

I would have added some component and e2e tests using Cypress. I would have implemented pagination and extended the `RvCard` component to display more information.
